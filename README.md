tongram
=======

`tongram` is a C++ library implementing the compressed and fast data structures described in the paper *Efficient Data Structures for Massive N-Gram Datasets* by Giulio Ermanno Pibiri and Rossano Venturini, ACM SIGIR 2017.

<!-- The project uses CMake. To build it on Unix systems it should be sufficient to
do the following:

	$ mkdir build; cd build
	$ cmake ..
    $ make -j[number of processes] -->
	
The code will be imported soon, as well as a complete README file containing detailed instructions on how to build and use the library.
